# Games-Week-Project

   Repo for my games week project for Sparta Global. I have made a arcade type top-down 2D shooter where you play as a soldier who fights of zombies while surviving as many rounds as possible. The main code is located [here](https://github.com/SamRibes/Games-Week-Project/tree/master/Zombie%20Attack/Main).
